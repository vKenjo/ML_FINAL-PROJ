# Final Project: Fine-tuning Pre-trained Neural Networks

## Objective

Your primary objective is to fine-tune a pre-trained neural network and use it on a task that you want to work on. It is up to you whatever task you work on, if it is a supervised or unsupervised problem, if it is regression or classification, etc. What's important is that you fine-tune a pre-trained neural network to accomplish the task at hand.

## Final Project Expected Activities

You are expected to do the following during the course of your project:

1. **Identify your group members.** Each group should strictly be 6 members
2. **Choose a problem that you want to tackle.** This can range from identifying cell types in images, classifying the age of a person, etc. Note that the problem should not be too easy, nor should it be too hard.
3. **Look for a dataset for the problem that you want to solve.** You can look for datasets in Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, OpenML, Amazon, etc.
4. **Apply preprocessing and data preparation.** Before handling any task, you would almost always need to do some preprocessing of the dataset that you chose.
5. **Train and fine-tune a pre-trained neural network** for the specific task that you want to do. You'll get to know more of neural networks and pre-trained networks in the upcoming weeks.
6. **Evaluate and analyze the results** of your fine-tuned neural network. Similar to lab exercises, you need to evaluate the performance of the neural network before fine-tuning and after fine-tuning the neural network. Select the appropriate metrics. Do error analysis. Identify your model's weak points.
7. **Present and defend your findings** in class and possibly external audience as well.

## Deliverables

The expected deliverables are as follows:

1. Link to the dataset that was used.
2. Jupyter Notebooks and/or relevant source code that were used for the preprocessing, loading, training, and everything else in between
3. Final Powerpoint Presentation that will be used to present the experiments and findings in class. Make sure that this can all be presented within 15-20 minutes. The powerpoint presentation should contain at least the following:
   - Introduction
   - Details of the Dataset
   - Exploratory Data Analysis on the Dataset
   - Methodology (All details on preprocessing, pre-trained network chosen, training, testing, and other relevant details)
   - Evaluation Metrics
   - Results and Analysis
   - Conclusions
   - Recommendations

## Submission Guidelines

The submissions guidelines are as follows:

### For Canvas Submissions in this Assignment Link

- **Submission (May 16, 2025):** Before the day of the project presentation, submit all expected deliverables as discussed above. Late presentations and submissions will only get a maximum of 60% grade.

### For Peer and Self Evaluations

- **Form Submission (May 16, 2025):** Kindly provide your peer and self evaluations in the specified form

## Rubrics for Grading

You will be graded as follows:

- **Difficulty (5pts):** This component grades how hard the identified problem is based on the nature of the dataset and its corresponding details. (e.g., is it a multi-class classification problem? is it imbalanced? is the data used images? text?, etc.)
- **Methodology (5pts):** This component grades the proposed methodology based on much the concepts learned throughout the entire course have been incorporated, it also looks into the correctness of the proposed methodology, and finally, if it is implemented properly.
- **Experiments, Results, and Analysis (5pts):** This component grades the quantity and quality of experiments done as well as how the results are interpreted and analyzed by the group.
- **Self-Evaluation (5pts) and Peer Evaluation (5pts):** Examples of rating are shown below

## Mechanics for Self and Peer Evaluation

You are tasked with evaluating and scoring the contributions of everyone in your group, including yourself. This evaluation is based on each member's effort, participation, and impact on the project. Use the scoring system outlined below to fairly distribute points within the group.

### Scoring Limits

- **5 points:** Awarded only once to the member who contributed the most.
- **4 points:** Awarded only once to the member with the second-highest contribution.
- **3 points:** Can be awarded twice to members with notable contributions.
- **2 points:** Can be awarded twice to members with moderate contributions.
- **1 point:** Can be awarded three times to members with minimal contributions.
- **0 points:** Unlimited for members who made no contribution.

### Guidelines

- You must evaluate yourself alongside your group members.
- Points must not exceed the limits set for each category.
- Be objective and fair in your evaluation, basing your scores on tangible contributions such as work completed, attendance, participation, or initiative.

### Example Evaluation

**Scenario:** Maria is part of Group 1, which includes five members: Maria, Alex, Bella, Chris, and Dana.

**Submitted Scores:**

- Alex: 5
- Bella: 4
- Maria (self): 3
- Chris: 3
- Dana: 2

Looking forward to your projects. Good luck!
